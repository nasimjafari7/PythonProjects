    "# Microservices ECommerce\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will create fictional commerce microservices. This project includes four microservices; **Products**, **Customers**, **Orders**, and **Search**. The first three microservices will manage their own data. They will use in_memory data, but it is possible to change these to a real database quickly. The Search microservice will synchronously communicate to the other microservices to obtain data from a particular customer and return the aggregated data. To accomplish this, I will develop the microservices by using Visual Studio and .Net core and some unit tests using xUnit."

    "## Applied technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "The following technologies, classes, and design patterns have been used to implement the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### ASP .Net Core:\n",
    "I am going touse ASP.NET Core to create RESTful services, i.e., web APIs, using C#. for handling web API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Entity Framework Core: \n",
    "I am going to create a DbContext for each microservices (except Search). This Dbcontext is responsible for tracking all database changes, and it will be based on the Entity Framework Core, which is the object-relational mapper technology from Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### LINQ\n",
    "I am going to implement a provider class in each microservices as another layer on top of the DbContext. A client (here a controller) can use it to get or set data from/to the database without knowing or caring whether the data is coming from Entity Framework or a web API. In these providers, to get data, I am going to use LINQ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### HttpClient and HttpClientFactory \n",
    "I am going touse HttpClient class to send HTTP requests to the microservices and receive HTTP responses from microservices. I am also going to use HttpClientFactory to create an instance of HttpClient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### AutoMapper\n",
    "I am going to use AutoMAppaer class to transform the DB entities into the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ### xUnit: \n",
    "I am going to write some unit tests using xUnit and Mock class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Dependency Injection (DI)\n",
    "ASP.NET Core supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. I am going to use this pattern in my implementation."
