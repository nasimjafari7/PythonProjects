    "I am going to work with stock market data that was downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuZGF0YXF1ZXN0LmlvLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACbPS7xIVw4woj5nkyb2sh4eEmwPCsc4Xn0vKC8cQ4rS08l4oUOdzfp6R2SkBbQcJop2jETOZTkAr2sRAWMACt-r0dt35SJQre16QcHRMhGs_CSMLEh0GAMPEnnbUpLK0kdu1BH0D6qy8OChEoHs8brnI3YnnVLN4P4DkDzpzoct) using the [yahoo_finance](https://pypi.org/project/yahoo-finance/) Python package. This data consists of the daily stock prices from 2007-1-1 to 2017-04-17 for several hundred stock symbols traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange, stored in the prices folder. The download_data.py script in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook was used to download all of the stock price data. Each file in the prices folder is named for a specific stock symbol, and contains the:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **date** -- date that the data is from.\n",
    "- **close** -- the closing price on that day, which is the price when the trading day ends.\n",
    "- **open** -- the opening price on that day, which is the price when the trading day starts.\n",
    "- **high** -- the highest price the stock reached during trading.\n",
    "- **low** -- the lowest price the stock reached during trading.\n",
    "- **volume** -- the number of shares that were traded during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read in and store all of the data, I am going to use a **dictionary** where the keys are the stock symbols (name of the file without the .csv extension) and the value associated with each key is a DataFrame storing the data from the CSV file.\n",
    "For example, the **aapl.csv** data can be stored in an entry with **key \"aapl\"** and **value** is **the DataFrame obtained by reading the CSV file (\"prices/aapl.csv\")**."
